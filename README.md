# openai-questionnaire

a simple questionnaire that implements whispersAPI from openai and other related technologies to get responses from a youtube video.

# Theoretical Apporach:

1. Store vectors in pinecone
2. Store ids of pinecone vectors and text slices in mongodb
3. for a question, first perform vector search in pinecone, with the retrieved id, feed the text slice from mongodb to langchain and return the text generated by open AI.

# What I have accomplished

1. Downloading and converting small youtube videos to text.

2. Generate and upload pinecone vectors for such content.

3. Perform pinecone similarity search on those vectors.

# Problems and Opinions

1. The Whispers API has a limit of ~20 MB of content, the full audio of the question video is ~450MB, Sure, you can split it with ffmpeg and then the transcribe in parts but that seems to much effort and there aren't many local solutions for it, you need to sign up for an online solution and given the size of ~450MB it's hard to find a free service.

2. Pinecone returns similarity seach in vecors and I was unable to convert it back to text and somehow feed to a langhchain LLM chain. My alternate solution: store text slices in mongodb and link them with vector IDs, unfortunatley, I did not implement this because of time constrainsts.
